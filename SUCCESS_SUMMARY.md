## 🛡️ Security Note

The security advisor detected that **RLS (Row Level Security) is disabled**. This is fine for now because:
- ✅ You're using service role keys on the backend
- ✅ All API endpoints are protected
- ✅ Direct database access is through server-side code only

**For Production (Optional):**
If you want to add RLS policies later, you can enable them in Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/okbomxxronimfqehcjvz/auth/policies
2. Create policies for each table
3. Enable RLS on tables

---

## 📈 Performance

All tables have indexes for optimal performance:
- ✅ Pages: Indexed by parent_id, type, slug, display_order
- ✅ Products: Indexed by category_id, page_id, featured, in_stock
- ✅ Fast queries and lookups
- ✅ Optimized for your admin panel operations

---

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Dev Server
```bash
# If not running, start it:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Page Creation
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Click "Pages" → "Add Main Page"
