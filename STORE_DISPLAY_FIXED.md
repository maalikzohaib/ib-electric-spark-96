# âœ… STORE DISPLAY ISSUES FIXED!

## ðŸŽ‰ Both Problems Solved!

Both the **"products not showing on storefront"** and **"Add product error on featured page"** issues are now **COMPLETELY FIXED**!

---

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### **Problem 1: Products Not Showing on Storefront**
**Root Cause:** The product was created with `featured = false`, but the homepage only displays featured products.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the product to `featured = true` in the database
- Verified the boot API now returns 1 featured product

### **Problem 2: "Add Product" Error on Featured Page**
**Root Cause:** The `/api/products/:id/featured` endpoint was missing from the dev server configuration.

**Solution:**
- Added the missing endpoint to `dev-server.mjs`
- Fixed query parameter handling for all dynamic routes
- Updated all endpoints to use proper request object modification
