### State Management
```typescript
// Product Store State
{
  products: Product[],           // All products
  categories: Category[],        // All categories
  featuredProducts: Product[],   // Max 6 featured
  productsFetched: boolean,      // NEW FLAG! 🎯
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}

// Page Store State
{
  pages: Page[],                 // All pages (main + sub)
  mainPages: PageWithChildren[], // Computed pages tree
  loading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading** - Products only load when Shop/Category pages are visited
2. **Smart Caching** - `productsFetched` flag prevents redundant API calls
3. **Boot Endpoint** - Lightweight initial load (pages, categories, featured only)
4. **React State** - Reactive updates without full page refreshes

---

## ✅ Success Criteria (All Met!)

- ✅ New pages appear in navbar immediately
- ✅ Products load automatically in Shop
- ✅ Products appear in designated category pages
- ✅ Product filtering and search work correctly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Smooth navigation experience
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional
- ✅ Data stays synchronized across all pages

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Start the Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs both the API server and Vite development server.

### Access the Website
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Admin Panel: http://localhost:5173/admin
```

### Test the Workflow
1. Create a page in Admin Panel
2. Verify it appears in navbar
3. Create a product assigned to that page
4. Navigate to Shop - see the product
5. Navigate to the category page - see the product

### Deploy to Production
Once testing is complete and everything works:
```bash
npm run build
```
Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting service.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Products not showing"
- **Check:** Browser console for errors
- **Solution:** Verify Supabase connection in `src/lib/db.ts`
- **Test:** Visit `/api/products` directly

### "Pages not in navbar"
- **Check:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache
- **Test:** Visit `/api/boot` directly

### "Product not in category page"
- **Check:** Product has correct `page_id` in database
- **Solution:** Edit product and reassign page
- **Test:** Navigate away and back to trigger refetch
