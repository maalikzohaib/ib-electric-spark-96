## 📊 Test Results

I tested the API directly and confirmed:

```json
{
  "id": "ce41f2ca-c44e-429f-ac77-903926258fd2",
  "name": "Test Home Page",
  "title": "Test Home Page", 
  "slug": "test-home-page",
  "type": "main",
  "display_order": 1,
  "created_at": "2025-10-10T15:40:56.662+00:00"
}
```

**✅ Page creation is working perfectly!**

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### **Files Updated:**
1. **`.env`** - Updated with correct JWT service key
2. **`api/boot.ts`** - Rewritten to use Supabase query builder
3. **`api/pages/index.ts`** - Already using Supabase query builder
4. **`src/lib/db.ts`** - Environment variable handling fixed

### **Key Fix:**
The main issue was that the API endpoints were trying to use SQL template literals with a custom `exec_sql` function, but the simpler approach using Supabase's built-in query builder is more reliable and works better with the network restrictions.
