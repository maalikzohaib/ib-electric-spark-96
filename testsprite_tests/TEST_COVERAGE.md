# TestSprite Test Coverage

## Overview

This document outlines the test coverage for the Electric Spark e-commerce application, with a focus on the ProductCard component and productStore functionality.

## Component Tests

### ProductCard Component

The ProductCard component is tested in `product_component_test.js` with the following coverage:

1. **Structure Verification**
   - Product title presence and accessibility (using `id` attribute)
   - Price display with correct currency format
   - Stock status badge display
   - Image rendering

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Add to favorites functionality
   - Add to cart functionality
   - Toast notifications on actions
   - Keyboard navigation support

3. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA attributes validation
   - Keyboard interaction testing
   - Focus management

## Store Tests

### productStore

The productStore functionality is tested indirectly through component interactions:

1. **State Management**
   - Product data retrieval and display
   - Favorites state toggling
   - Cart state updates

2. **User Interactions**
   - Adding products to favorites
   - Adding products to cart
   - Navigation to product details

## Integration Tests

The tests verify the integration between components and stores:

1. **ProductCard + favoriteStore**
   - Adding/removing products from favorites
   - UI updates reflecting state changes

2. **ProductCard + cartStore**
   - Adding products to cart
   - Cart count updates

## Test Execution

Tests are executed using TestSprite with Puppeteer for browser automation. The tests simulate real user interactions and verify both visual elements and functional behavior.

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add isolated tests for productStore methods
   - Test edge cases for product data handling

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure rendering performance of ProductCard components
   - Test loading times with different product quantities

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test behavior when product data is incomplete
   - Verify error states in the UI
